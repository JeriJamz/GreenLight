#*These are go notes.Ima need some reminders
Lets go over Data Type Decla:

s := " ":
    This is a short Decla. Its Cool for In-Function but not the best for package stuff,
    This is BC a data type isn't declared:
	Once you play around with numbers it gets really messy. 

var s string:
    This is more of a proper long decla in Go. This would be more appropate(idk),
    for package level stuff. The "string" is a type of data. Like "long", "unsigned", "double". does this even have doubles?

var s = "":
    Ok now im going off wat the book says for this and the next,
    This is a rare Type Decla. This say this is a good short hand for when you,
    got multiple Vars.

var s string = " ":
    OK so with this. This is supposed to be a way to combine. The second and third method
    Its great for when you got a crap ton of Varis, your in the middle of a function,
    And you need to make sure some data is declared the right way
