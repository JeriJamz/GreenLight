Mo Network notes

This is really over socket level programming in go

Ip are jus Binary
TCP\UDP are the Thickest.(Yea I love my strippers) of the addressing way
LAN is Locan Area Network and its mainly ethernet cords and everything talkin to one server
WAN is more of the internet
IP comes as a stack:
    OSI is a 3 layer stack
    TCP\UDP is a 4-layer stack
    SCTP(Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is the newest craze, its meant to keep the internet in the sky:
	Think more of starlink:
	     DTN(Delay Tolerant Network) ima assume helps with the crazy delay it takes,
	     When moving the waves around. Mind you were shootin them in space. Through the air.
	     So it gonna be sum delay. Hopefully the aim good enough

#*			SIDE NOTE

	"App"("OSI" 5-7)<-->"TCP"(or)"UDP"(both, "OSI" 4)<-->"IP"("OSI" 3)<-->"H\W" InterFace("OSI" 1-2)

*#

"TCP" is more of connection oreiented, "UDP" is not:
    "UDP"(User Datagram Protocol)

*IP DATAGRAM:
IPs are fun
This is what makes it connectionless but unsecure
when making the "IP" layer:
    You have to give "IP" its own header:
        In that header it going to contain the Starting Locations and Finishing Location(GeoLocation, Coordinates):
	    See why its so important what we hid that.
"IP" handles the routing(I think it make sure you hit the right ports)
Also "IP" breakdown Large Datagrams into smaller ones and then on top of that it reassembles them

*UDP:
Also connectionless and Unsecure.
It adds an checksum for the Contents on the Datagram and port numbers:
    Other words it gives the "IP" Better instructions to follow
This is more for Client-Server stuff

*TCP:
Supplies Logic to a reliable connection-orentend protocol above "IP".
Its like a Virtual Bridge that allows two Process(Protocols?) to communicate.
Also it uses port numbers to indentfy Host-Server-Services.(Like a Verify)

#Ok Fun Part. Internet Addressing

IPv4 is 32-bit unsigned int.#All the C Programmers gotta love this
#*Oh yea Ip is what hooks you up to the internet.  You computer may not have an IP
But your Modem does. Your phone dont but the Cell Tower does so*#
